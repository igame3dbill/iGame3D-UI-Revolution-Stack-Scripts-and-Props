This appears to be the last working Runtime Revolution .rev stack but I don't have an old
version of Runtime Revolution for windows to test it.

The iGame3D Player051707.exe was built May 17, 2007 and has a working rudimentary murgaLua UI

iGame3D Pro External.dll built 02/12/2007 is different from iGame3D Pro External051707.dll but I don't know how, we worked for four years without any source version control yikes!

May 17 2017 looks like the last build of the iGame3D Pro External.dll for Runtime Revolution.
It it includes a method to run murgalua from Livecode.
