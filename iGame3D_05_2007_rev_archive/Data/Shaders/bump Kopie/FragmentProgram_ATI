# Simple Bump Mapping by James A. McCombe, Tue Jun 17 2003
#
# Implements a simple per pixel lighting model in which the dot product of a 
# per pixel normal vector and light direction vector are used to highlight/shadow a 
# pixel.  After that, its modulated with a base texture map to produce a "bumpy" surface
#
# Texture Units:
# 	Unit 0 - Per pixel normals encoded as colors
#   Unit 1 - Base texture map
#
# Parameters:
#   program.env[0].xyz - Controls the light direction

StartConstants;
	CONSTANT c0 = program.env[0];
	CONSTANT c1 = { 0.5, 0, 0, 0.0};
EndConstants;



StartOutputPass;
	SampleMap r0, t0.str; # Sample the normal map texel into r0 
	SampleMap r1, t1.str; # Sample the base texel into r1


	# Scale the normal map color into vector space
	SUB  r0.rgb.2x, r0, c1.r;

	# Translate the light direction parameter into normalised signed space
    # ATI_text_fragment_shader doesn't support signed and/or unnormalised constants
	# or parameters

	SUB r2.rgb.2x, c0, c1.r;

	# Perform dot product with light direction vector
	DOT3 r0.rgb, r0, r2;
	
	# Modulate with base texture
	#MUL  r0, r0, r1;
EndPass;
